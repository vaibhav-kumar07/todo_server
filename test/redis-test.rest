### Test Redis Functionality

@url = http://localhost:3000/api/v1

### 1. Test Redis Health Check (if Redis is configured)
GET {{url}}/health/redis

### 2. Test Analytics (should work with or without Redis)
GET {{url}}/analytics/realtime

### 3. Test Event Logging (should work with or without Redis)
POST {{url}}/auth/login
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "email": "admin@taskmanagement.com",
  "password": "Admin123!"
}

### 4. Check if Redis is actually running
# You can also test Redis directly with:
# redis-cli ping
# Should return PONG if Redis is running

### Expected Behavior:
# - If Redis is not configured: Should see warnings but app should work
# - If Redis is configured but not running: Should see connection errors but app should work
# - If Redis is configured and running: Should see success messages
